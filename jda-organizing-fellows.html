							<p>The GenVote JDA Organizing Fellows program is a unique opportunity to join a national youth-led cohort dedicated to addressing our country’s democratic crises and reimagining a just democracy for all. In the face of a gridlocked Congress and continued attacks on our democracy at the local, state, and federal levels, we are equipping GenVoters with the tools that they need to plan actions, build youth-led Teams and Hubs, and be able to talk to anyone about our generation’s democratic crisis at the local and state level.
								<br><br>
							The GenVote National Just Democracy for All (JDA) Organizing Fellows program is a paid opportunity for 15 working-class fellows, ages 15-35, to develop as leaders in the GenVote network with 1-1 coaching, training to spark new GenVote Teams and Hubs, and inspire hundreds of young people to fight for our right to vote and a just democracy for all.</p>
